            <h1>2008 Corvette botched repair job</h1>
        </div>
            <p>The "repairs" performed by Nissani Bros. Chevrolet in Culver City, CA. This cost me a little over $6,800 for torque tube and harmonic balancer replacement.</p>
            <p>In addition to the botched repair job... leading up to the repairs was a nightmare. I was lied to regarding financing of the actual repairs. I was traveling and using savings for rent as I got settled back into California and starting a new job hunt and attending a semester at CCSF. After asking several times about any last-minute "I gotchas" or "11th hour issues," I was told that the full amount of repairs could be financed. I authorized repairs and about a week later, I was notified that my car was ready for pickup. I then received a phone call several minutes later from William and he told me that he just looked up financing information and that only the first $3000 could be financed and I would have to pay the rest. It seems kind of odd that an experienced professional in the service department was unaware of this... The result was me becoming homeless and living in a van, having to use my savings set aside for rent to pay for this repair in order to avoid a lien sale.</p>
            <p>Not long after picking up the car, I started smelling gas, hearing very loud rattling noises and heavy vibrations. I took the car into a dealership here in San Francisco and this is the botched job that was found. Video below.
