	<!-- properly formated the <h1> style to include " " and lowercase for uniformity. -->
	<h1 style="text-align:center">CNIT-132 Homework 1</h1>
	<p>In this homework we will be changing this code to be a valid code in HTML5.
	<p>We will probably need to change a lot of details around the code and the basic idea of this Homework is to learn how to use the validator from W3C.</p>

	<!-- Moved the image tag outside of the <p> tag to keep content types separate separate. Added an <alt> tag to <img>. I also renamed the src to appropriate asset folder within my hierarchy on my server because I host many webpages and structure can get confusing with my other projects -->
	<img style="float:left;" src="img/oldboat.gif" alt="old boat"><p>The image you see here will be used a lot in many exercises we will be doing in class! This is an old boat, probably an old ship. One of those types used to transport heavy cargo in the old times?!?! Of course this picture is not real, but you can imagine a big boat made basically of wood and using the main power of the wind! Remember that this picture needs to be uploaded to the Hills Server (your account) together with this file you are modifying, otherwise, the picture will not be shown!</p>
	<p>You will be able to change a little bit the content of the two paragraphs below to insert the links requested to make sense when reading the content.</p>

	<!-- Link to external page in new tab -->
	<p>This webpage:<a rel="noopener" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp" title="Go to W3Schools HTML Links Section" target="_blank">W3 Schools HTML Links</a> is where I referenced the syntax for creating this link and should be bookmarked on every developer's web browser.</p> 

	<!-- Link to external page in new tab to an #id contained found in DOM -->
	<p>This second link: <a rel="noopener" href="http://www.ccsf.edu/en/student-services/student-counseling.html#subcontent" title="Go to CCSF Counseling" target="_blank">CCSF Counseling</a> will take you to a specific location on the CCSF Counseling page so that the most relevant content is placed in front of you without having to scroll and search.</p>
	<p>Include here below a horizontal ruler to divide the page</p>
	
	<!-- Added ruler to separate page content -->
	<hr>

	<!-- Section tags typically need an <h> tag followed by content like <p> tags. I moved the H2 and a few <p> tags into this <section tag. Deleted unnecessary <br> tags -->
	<section>
		<H2>Subtitle of our page</H2>
		<p>It's funny to see this page being upgraded.</p>
		<p>We will be dealing with a lot of details in this code and that's the idea of this exercise!</p>
		<p>At least I am using one new HTML5 tag - the section tag. Not sure if I am using it correctly!</p>
	</section>

	<!-- Designated that the items were part of an unordered list by adding <ul> and also the ending tags required of <li> -->
	<p>I am trying to build an unordered list here below. Would you be able to help me?</p>
	<ul>
		<li>planning a web page</li>
		<li>studying the target audience</li>
		<li>following standards when coding</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Make sure you upload your file to Hills, inside the public_html folder, make sure also to upload the image of the oldboat but, especially for his work, make sure you validate your code!</p>
